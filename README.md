I developed this php framework akin MVC till 2015 in order for enhance my knowledges in design patterns and php.
And It was my course work.

Here was mastered:
  - .htaccess
  - OOP, PDO, Reflections, Standard PHP Library,...
  - Patterns: Singletone, Regisrty, Strategy, MVC
  - parsing XML, JSON ...
  - REST API

Now I see my  mistakes I made then.
